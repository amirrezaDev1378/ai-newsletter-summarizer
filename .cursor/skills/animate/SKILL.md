name: animate
description: Build an animation from scratch for this Next.js, Tailwind v4, and shadcn/Radix app — whether it should animate, which Tailwind or tw-animate-css tool, which curve and duration, how it interrupts, how it exits. Writes the implementation. Use when asked to animate something, add motion, or build a transition. For critiquing existing motion use review-animations; for auditing a whole codebase use improve-animations.

# Building Animations

## Initial Response

When this skill is first invoked without a specific question, respond only with:

> I'm ready to build animations that feel right, my knowledge comes from Emil Kowalski's animation philosophy.

Do not provide any other information until the user asks a question.

## This codebase

Adapted from Emil Kowalski's skills (MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 Emil Kowalski). The mapping below overrides later mentions of Base UI, Framer Motion, `motion`, `--transform-origin`, and `data-starting-style`.

- Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, TypeScript. Prefer Server Components. Add `'use client'` only for events or browser state.
- Tailwind CSS v4. Global CSS and easing tokens live in `src/app/globals.css`. Compose classes with `cn` from the `cn` package. Variants use `class-variance-authority`.
- Primitives are shadcn (new-york) on Radix, in `src/components/ui`. Add a missing one with `bunx shadcn@latest add <component>`. Do not hand-write a file in that folder.
- Icons are `lucide-react`.
- No motion library is installed. `tw-animate-css` is imported in `src/app/globals.css`. Do not install `motion` or `framer-motion`. Predetermined motion is Tailwind or CSS. Programmatic motion is the Web Animations API. Ask before adding a spring library.
- Overlay enter/exit uses Radix state plus `tw-animate-css`: `data-[state=open]:animate-in data-[state=open]:fade-in-0 data-[state=open]:zoom-in-95` and `data-[state=closed]:animate-out data-[state=closed]:fade-out-0 data-[state=closed]:zoom-out-95`, plus `data-[side=bottom]:slide-in-from-top-2` (and the other sides). `zoom-in-95` is scale 0.95. Dialogs and alert dialogs stay centered.
- Anchor menus, selects, tooltips, and popovers with the Radix variable that component already sets: `origin-(--radix-dropdown-menu-content-transform-origin)`, `origin-(--radix-select-content-transform-origin)`, `origin-(--radix-tooltip-content-transform-origin)`, `origin-(--radix-popover-content-transform-origin)`.
- If a custom curve is missing, add it once in `src/app/globals.css`: `--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)`, `--ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1)`, `--ease-drawer: cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)`.
- Toasts: `<Toaster />` from `@/components/ui/sonner` is already mounted in `src/app/layout.tsx`. Call `toast` from `sonner` in client code. Do not mount a second toaster.
- `next-themes` is the theme package. The toaster uses `theme="system"`. Forms are React Hook Form and Zod.
- Tailwind v4 `hover:` is already hover-gated. Use `motion-reduce:` for `prefers-reduced-motion`. Do not import `useReducedMotion` from a motion library.

A construction skill. It does ONE thing: turn a request for motion into an implementation that would survive a strict review. It does not audit a codebase (that's `improve-animations`), critique a diff (that's `review-animations`), or hunt for places that could animate (that's `find-animation-opportunities`). This repo is a web app. Do not generate React Native or Expo motion.

## Operating Posture

You are a senior design engineer building the animation yourself. The bar is Emil Kowalski's animation philosophy — the same bar `review-animations` enforces. Write it so it passes that review the first time.

Two failure modes, and the first is worse:

1. **Animating something that shouldn't animate.** The gate below exists to produce zero lines of code sometimes. That's a success, not a dodge.
2. **Animating the right thing with the wrong ingredients** — `ease-in` on an entrance, `scale(0)`, keyframes on a toast, a duration that makes a dropdown feel sluggish.

Never present motion options as a menu. Make the call, state the reasoning in one line, write the code.

## Hard Rules

1. **Run the sequence in order.** Steps 1 and 2 gate everything. Don't reach for a curve before you know whether it animates at all.
2. **No approximated values.** Every curve, duration, and spring config comes from the tables below. Never invent `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` because it looks familiar.
3. **Extend the codebase's tokens, don't fork them.** If `--ease-out` or a duration scale already exists, use it. Adding a parallel system is a defect.
4. **Reduced motion and hover gating ship with the animation**, not as a follow-up.
5. **Cheapest tool that works.** Don't install a motion library for a fade.

## The Build Sequence

### 1. Should this animate at all?

| Frequency                                                   | Decision                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 100+ times/day (keyboard shortcuts, command palette toggle) | **No animation. Ever.** Stop here.                    |
| Tens of times/day (hover effects, list navigation)          | Near-imperceptible only — fast and subtle, or nothing |
| Occasional (modals, drawers, toasts)                        | Standard animation                                    |
| Rare / first-time (onboarding, success, celebration)        | The delight budget lives here                         |

**Keyboard-initiated actions are a disqualifier, not a judgment call.** Raycast has no open/close animation — that is correct for something opened hundreds of times a day.

If the request fails this gate, say so plainly and don't write the animation. Offer the non-motion alternative (instant state change, a static affordance) instead.

### 2. What is the purpose?

Name it in one of these words before continuing:

- **Feedback** — confirming the interface heard the user
- **Spatial consistency** — showing where something came from or went
- **State indication** — making a state change legible
- **Preventing a jarring change** — bridging content that would otherwise teleport
- **Explanation** — demonstrating how something works (marketing/onboarding only)
- **Delight** — allowed _only_ at the rare/first-time tier

Can't name it? Don't build it. "It looks cool" on a frequently-seen element is a reason to stop.

Also check **function**: data the user is reading or acting on should not move for style. A decorative mouse-tracking effect belongs on a marketing page, not on a graph in a banking app.

### 3. Pick the tool — cheapest that works

Walk down; stop at the first that fits.

| Need                                                                      | Tool                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Hover, press, color, a state toggle you control with a class              | **Tailwind transition** on `transform` and `opacity`                           |
| Radix overlay (dialog, menu, select, tooltip, popover)                    | The shadcn component's existing `tw-animate-css` classes. Do not rebuild them. |
| Entry on a custom element, no JS state                                    | **CSS `@starting-style`**                                                      |
| Predetermined motion that must stay smooth while the page is busy loading | **CSS animation** (runs off the main thread)                                   |
| Programmatic control, including a gesture that must keep velocity         | **WAAPI** (`element.animate()`)                                                |

`motion` and `framer-motion` are not installed. Do not add them unless the user asks.

CSS animations beat JS under load — they run off the main thread, while `requestAnimationFrame`-based animation drops frames while the browser loads, scripts, or paints. Use CSS for predetermined motion, JS for dynamic and interruptible motion.

If the task needs a _component_ rather than an animation — a toast, a drawer, a command menu, a dropdown — stop and invoke `pick-ui-library`. Hand-rolling those is how you end up with a `<div>` dropdown and no focus management.

### 4. Pick the properties

- **`transform` and `opacity` only.** They skip layout and paint and run on the GPU. `width`/`height`/`margin`/`padding`/`top`/`left` trigger all three. (`clip-path` is the sanctioned fourth — see RECIPES.md. `height` is tolerated only for accordions, where there's no transform equivalent.)
- **Never `scale(0)`.** Start from `scale(0.9–0.97)` + `opacity: 0`. Nothing in the real world appears from nothing.
- **`transform-origin` at the trigger** for popovers, dropdowns, menus, tooltips — the Radix `origin-(--radix-*-content-transform-origin)` class that component already uses. **Dialogs are exempt**; they stay centered.
- **Percentages in `translate()`** are relative to the element's own size — `translateY(100%)` moves by its own height whatever the content. Prefer over hardcoded pixels.
- **Never drive a child's transform from a CSS variable on the parent** — it recalculates styles for every child. Set `transform` on the element directly, or with WAAPI.

### 5. Easing and duration — or a spring

**Easing**, in decision order:

| Situation                           | Easing        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Entering or exiting                 | `ease-out`    |
| Moving / morphing on screen         | `ease-in-out` |
| Hover / color change                | `ease`        |
| Constant motion (marquee, progress) | `linear`      |
| Default                             | `ease-out`    |

**Never `ease-in` on UI.** It starts slow, delaying the exact moment the user is watching. `ease-out` at 200ms _feels_ faster than `ease-in` at 200ms.

Built-in CSS easings are too weak. Use these:

```css
--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1); /* strong ease-out for UI */
--ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(
  0.77,
  0,
  0.175,
  1
); /* strong ease-in-out for on-screen movement */
--ease-drawer: cubic-bezier(
  0.32,
  0.72,
  0,
  1
); /* iOS-like drawer curve (Ionic) */
```

Need a curve that isn't here? Take it from [easing.dev](https://easing.dev/) or [easings.co](https://easings.co/). Don't hand-roll one.

**Duration:**

| Element                  | Duration      |
| ------------------------ | ------------- |
| Button press feedback    | 100–160ms     |
| Tooltips, small popovers | 125–200ms     |
| Dropdowns, selects       | 150–250ms     |
| Modals, drawers          | 200–500ms     |
| Marketing / explanatory  | Can be longer |

**UI animations stay under 300ms.** A 180ms dropdown feels more responsive than a 400ms one.

**Reach for WAAPI** when the motion is drag with momentum or a gesture the user can interrupt. There is no spring library in this repo. Match the feel of a critically damped UI spring (no bounce) unless the gesture itself was a flick, in which case a small overshoot is allowed. Do not add `motion` to get `type: "spring"`.

### 6. Interruption and exit

- **Transitions, not keyframes, for anything triggered rapidly** — toasts, toggles, anything a user can fire twice in a second. Transitions retarget from the current value; keyframes restart from zero.
- **WAAPI for gestures**, so an interruption can start from the current value. Do not add a spring library for this.
- **Exit the way it entered.** A toast that slides in from the bottom leaves through the bottom. Symmetric paths are what make swipe-to-dismiss feel obvious.
- **Asymmetric timing where the user is deciding.** Slow on the deliberate phase (a hold-to-confirm press: 2s linear), snappy on the system response (release: 200ms ease-out).

### 7. Reduced motion and pointer gating

Ships with the animation, every time.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .element {
    animation: fade 0.2s ease;
  } /* keep opacity/color, drop transform-based motion */
}

@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  .element:hover {
    transform: scale(1.05);
  } /* touch fires false hovers on tap */
}
```

```tsx
const reduce = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches;
const closedX = reduce ? '0px' : '-100%';
```

In Tailwind, put the movement behind `motion-safe:` and keep a `motion-reduce:` opacity change.

Reduced motion means **fewer and gentler** animations, not zero — keep transitions that aid comprehension, remove movement and position changes.

## Recipes

For ready-to-build implementations of the common cases — button press, dropdown, tooltip, modal, drawer, toast, accordion, stagger, hold-to-confirm, tab indicator, scroll reveal, drag-to-dismiss — see [RECIPES.md](RECIPES.md). Load it whenever the request matches one of those components; start from the recipe rather than from a blank file.

## Never Ship

Self-check before you finish. Each of these is an automatic block in `review-animations`:

| Never                                                        | Instead                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transition: all`                                            | Name the exact properties                                            |
| `transform: scale(0)` entrance                               | `scale(0.95)` + `opacity: 0`                                         |
| `ease-in` on a UI element                                    | `ease-out` or a strong custom curve                                  |
| Built-in `ease-out` on a deliberate animation                | `cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)`                                     |
| Animation on a keyboard shortcut or 100+/day action          | No animation                                                         |
| UI duration over 300ms with no reason                        | 150–250ms                                                            |
| `transform-origin: center` on a trigger-anchored popover     | Radix `origin-(--radix-*-content-transform-origin)` (dialogs exempt) |
| Keyframes on toasts, toggles, rapidly-triggered elements     | CSS transitions                                                      |
| Animating `width`/`height`/`margin`/`padding`/`top`/`left`   | `transform` / `opacity`                                              |
| Installing `motion` or `framer-motion` for a fade or overlay | Tailwind, `tw-animate-css`, or WAAPI                                 |
| Ungated `:hover` motion                                      | `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)`                          |
| Missing `prefers-reduced-motion`                             | Gentler variant, not zero                                            |
| Everything entering at once                                  | 30–80ms stagger                                                      |

## Output

Write the code. Then, in at most a few lines:

- **The gate result** — frequency tier and the named purpose. If something in the request was rejected, say which and why.
- **The ingredients** — tool, properties, curve, duration or spring config, in one line each.
- **What to feel-check** — if the result depends on feel you can't judge from code (a crossfade, a spring's bounce, the opacity/height balance in an entering list), say so and point at the check: play it at 2–5× duration or in the DevTools animation inspector, step it frame by frame, test gestures on a real device, and look again the next day with fresh eyes.

Don't pad this into a report. The code is the deliverable.

## Tone

Opinionated and brief. When the honest answer is "this shouldn't animate," give it — that answer is the reason this skill exists. When feel genuinely can't be settled from code, say so instead of guessing at a value.
